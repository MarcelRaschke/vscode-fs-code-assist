# Toadman Code Assist

This is a fork of Fatshark's code assist for use with Toadman's tools.

Integrated the source from the vscode-lua extension https://github.com/trixnz/vscode-lua as a starting point to integrate the linter more deeply with the Toadman engine. Thank you trixnz üôè

## Install
Available on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Toadman.toadman-code-assist

Alternatively, if you're developing it you can also clone the repo into `%UserProfile%/.vscode/extensions`.

Make sure to define the toolchain path:

To launch the game with the debugger attached, you need to setup your launch.json. Here's how:

In order for the linter to work, make sure that luacheck (https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck) is available in the PATH. Or specify the path in the settings.
